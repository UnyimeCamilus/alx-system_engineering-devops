ways to better explain our web world with the help of a diagram


The flow starts with DNS resolution where our browser check a DNS server to resolve the domain name "www.google.com" to an IP address.
Our browser then establishes a TCP/IP connection to the IP address obtained from the DNS server.
The traffic is encrypted as indicated by the "Encrypted" arrows between our browser and Google's server, ensuring secure communication.
The connection passes through a firewall, which control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
Google's infrastructure likely employs load balancers to distribute incoming requests across multiple web servers for load balancing and high availability.
The request reaches a web server, which hosts the Google search web application and serves the requested content.
Behind the scenes, an application server may handle the logic of the Google search service, generating the web page content dynamically.
The application server may need to request data from a database server to fulfill the user's request, such as fetching indexed web pages or user preferences.
This diagram provides a high-level overview of the flow of the request from your browser to Google's servers and back.
